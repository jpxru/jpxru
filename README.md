Final Project

The title for my final project submission is called MovieMate. The puropse of this project was to develop a 
specialized movie search engine that aggregates relevant data for the user to make a prompt and informed
decision when looking for a movie to watch. The program was intended to utilize three different film rating 
services: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic. However, I did not have the experience required to incorporate
all three rating services, and I was only able to utilize the IMDb database for this search engine. There were
no existing databases for Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, which meant that I would've had to scrape all 
available film data from each website and aggregate into a database. I was unable to access all of each of 
the websites film data, which would've been the first step in creating a database. I was, however, able to 
access the IMDb film database and incorporate that into the program. The user is able to search any film they 
want, and is able to select from the search results yielded from the user input. Upon selection, the program 
pulls up all relevant details into a brief truncated summary. That was all I was able to accomplish in this 
project. Although I'm disappointed that I couldn't include all three sources, I was able to utilize IMDdPY
into the program and develop a working film search engine that pulls up relevant data for the user. I achieved 
my objective in the most basic sense.
